**Project Overview:**
In this project, I was responsible for designing and implementing network infrastructures for both primary and secondary business sites. The goal was to ensure seamless connectivity, robust security, and efficient IP addressing across both locations. This involved developing a detailed IP addressing scheme, configuring network devices, and ensuring secure communication between the sites.

**Primary Site:**
Devices and Configuration:

PCs: 15 workstations connected to a central switch.

Servers: 3 servers for handling different business applications.

Router: Configured for internal and external traffic management.

Firewall: Cisco ASA 5506-X for robust security.

Switches: Two switches to manage internal network traffic.

IP Addressing:
Utilized Class C private IP addresses (192.168.1.0/24).
Detailed IP addressing plan ensuring efficient use of available IPs.

**Secondary Site:**
Devices and Configuration:

PCs: 5 workstations connected to a central switch.
Router: Configured to manage local and remote traffic.
Firewall: Cisco ASA 5506-X for enhanced security.
Switches: Switches to manage the internal network.
IP Addressing:

Utilized Class C private IP addresses (192.168.2.0/24).
A well-structured IP addressing plan specific to the secondary site.

Responsibilities:

Developed a comprehensive IP address plan for both sites using specified private address ranges (Class A, B, C).
Configured routers, firewalls, and switches to ensure optimal performance and security.
Ensured connectivity between all devices within each site and established secure communication channels between the primary and secondary sites.
Documented the network design, including floor plans, device configurations, and IP address tables.
Skills Utilized:

Network design and implementation.
Cisco device configuration, specifically ASA 5506-X firewalls.
IP addressing and subnetting.
Network security best practices.
Creation of detailed network diagrams and documentation.

**Project Outcome:**

Successfully designed and implemented a robust network infrastructure for both sites.
Ensured secure and efficient communication between the primary and secondary business sites.
Provided comprehensive documentation and network diagrams for future reference and maintenance.
